# PWA Setup for WhereYouAt

Your app is now configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA)! Here's what's been set up and what you need to do:

## ‚úÖ What's Already Configured

1. **Web App Manifest** (`public/manifest.json`)

   - App name, description, colors
   - Display mode set to "standalone" (app-like experience)
   - Icon references (you need to add actual icons)

2. **Service Worker** (`public/sw.js`)

   - Basic caching for offline functionality
   - Handles install, fetch, and activate events

3. **PWA Meta Tags** (in `app/root.tsx`)

   - Theme color, description
   - Apple-specific meta tags for iOS
   - Manifest link

4. **Install Prompt Component** (`app/components/PWAInstallPrompt.tsx`)
   - Shows install button when app can be installed
   - Handles the installation process

## üîß What You Need to Do

### 1. Add App Icons

Replace the placeholder files with actual PNG icons:

- `public/icon-192x192.png` (192x192 pixels)
- `public/icon-512x512.png` (512x512 pixels)

You can create these using:

- [Favicon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/)
- [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
- Design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Photoshop

### 2. Test PWA Features

1. Build your app: `npm run build`
2. Serve it over HTTPS (required for service workers)
3. Open Chrome DevTools ‚Üí Application tab
4. Check:
   - Manifest is loaded correctly
   - Service Worker is registered
   - "Install" option appears in browser menu

### 3. Deploy with HTTPS

PWAs require HTTPS to work (except on localhost). Make sure your deployment includes SSL certificates.

## üöÄ PWA Features

Once deployed, your app will have:

- ‚úÖ Installable on desktop and mobile
- ‚úÖ App-like experience (no browser UI)
- ‚úÖ Offline functionality (basic caching)
- ‚úÖ Install prompt for users
- ‚úÖ Proper app icons and metadata

## üì± Testing Installation

1. **Desktop (Chrome/Edge)**: Look for the install icon in the address bar
2. **Mobile (Chrome)**: Use "Add to Home Screen" from the menu
3. **iOS Safari**: Use "Add to Home Screen" from the share menu

## üîÑ Updating the Service Worker

When you update your app, the service worker will automatically cache the new version. Users will get the update on their next visit.

## üìù Customization

You can customize:

- App colors in `manifest.json` (theme_color, background_color)
- Cached files in `sw.js` (urlsToCache array)
- Install prompt text in `PWAInstallPrompt.tsx`
- App name and description in `manifest.json`
